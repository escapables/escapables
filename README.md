# Hello!

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm a hobbyist experimenting with AI, large language models, and agentic coding systems.

I don't give agency to the AI beyond limited scopes depending on the context. I cannot write code but I can read and understand it and know when things are good or bad. Sort of like Rick Rubin but for computers. I design all my commits manually and then outsource all the manual labor to the Codex factory, and when that code comes back I close my eyes, massage my toes, and make a Decision, and in the end there is good software. If you don't believe me check out my MOTIS fork further down below.

I have extensive knowledge of hardware and software in general and have been tinkering with them for over twenty years.

## 🤖 About Me

I'm an AI enthusiast with a deep interest in how large language models work—their architecture, capabilities, and practical applications. I'm fascinated by how AI agents can autonomously solve problems and generate solutions. My GitHub presence is primarily educational, serving as a space to experiment with and explore the possibilities of agentic coding.

## 🎯 My Interests

- **Large Language Models**: Understanding transformer architecture, training, fine-tuning, and inference
- **AI Coding Agents**: How autonomous agents leverage LLMs to write, debug, and optimize code
- **Model Capabilities & Limitations**: Exploring what LLMs can and cannot do effectively
- **Practical Applications**: Real-world use cases where AI agents add value
- **Educational Exploration**: Learning through experimentation and hands-on projects

## 🚀 Current Project

### [motis-portable](https://github.com/escapables/motis-portable)

A fork of **MOTIS** (Mobility, Tourism, Information System)—a sophisticated open-source transportation planning system. This project transforms MOTIS into a portable application that can run directly from a USB drive, making it accessible and distributable without complex installation requirements.

**Key Aspects:**
- Demonstrates how agentic systems can tackle infrastructure modernization
- Explores portability and accessibility in complex transportation software
- A practical testbed for AI-assisted problem-solving in real-world domains

## 💡 Why This Fascinates Me

I'm captivated by how AI coding agents can:
- Understand complex existing codebases
- Refactor and optimize systems for different use cases
- Navigate multi-domain challenges (transportation systems, portability, performance)
- Generate solutions that would traditionally require deep domain expertise

This project is my way of exploring these capabilities in a meaningful, real-world context.

## 📚 What You'll Find Here

- **Experiments** with agentic coding approaches
- **Documentation** of my learning journey with LLMs and AI systems
- **Projects** that showcase practical applications of AI assistance
- **Notes and observations** about what AI agents do well and where they struggle
