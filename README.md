# Hello!

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm a hobbyist experimenting with LLMs and agentic coding systems.

I don't give agency to the AI beyond limited scopes depending on the context. That means I give the computer a specific task to iterate on until the source code reaches a point of stability/security/effectivity that I'm satisfied with. I cannot write code but I can read and understand it and know when it produces a program that is good or bad. Sort of like Rick Rubin but for computers.

I design all my commits manually and then outsource all the manual labor to the Codex factory, and when that code comes back I close my eyes, massage my toes, and make a Decision, and in the end there is good software (well, good enough at least for my purposes and they work the way I want them to without any issues -- `motis-portable` has been tested extensively). If you don't believe me check out my MOTIS fork further down below.

I have extensive knowledge of hardware and software in general and have been tinkering with them for over twenty years.

## Current Project

### [motis-portable](https://github.com/escapables/motis-portable)

A fork of **MOTIS** (Mobility, Tourism, Information System)—a sophisticated open-source transportation planning system. This project transforms MOTIS into a portable application that can run directly from a USB drive, making it accessible and distributable without complex installation requirements.

**Key Aspects:**
- Demonstrates how agentic systems can tackle infrastructure modernization
- Explores portability and accessibility in complex transportation software
- A practical testbed for AI-assisted problem-solving in real-world domains
